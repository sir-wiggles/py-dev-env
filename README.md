Dev setup for golang with vim + plugins
========================================
This is my dev environment setup, hugely simplified thanks to Docker. This is what it contains (and I use):

Personal usage
===============
I've been using this setup since Dec'14. Only recently thought of releasing this to support more active golang development (c'mon, leave Python already!). I always had problem getting YouCompleteMe to work well in my dev environment with Golang, and with this setup, I fixed that problem once and for all.

Notes
======
Modify this Dockerfile to adjust to your usage pattern, preferences etc. If you think your contribution is of interest to general public, do send me a patch, and I'll definitely consider it.
